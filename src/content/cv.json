        "description": "I am a PhD student in the Department of Astronautics at Imperial College of London. I graduated in 2023 in Mathematics at Autonomous University of Barcelona and next year I moved to Paris to pursue a master degree at Dauphine-PSL University in Applied and Theoretical Mathematics. My main interests are in the field of Computational Mathematics and PDEs. Specifically, I am particularly interested in the application of Mathematics to Fluid Dynamics.",
