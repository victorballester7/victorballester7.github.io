Hey there! I'm VÃ­ctor, a PhD student in Aeronautics at [Imperial College London](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/). I grew up in Badalona, a city near Barcelona. I did my undergraduate studies in Mathematics at [Autonomous University of Barcelona](https://www.uab.cat/). Then I moved to Paris, where I pursued my master's degree in Applied and Theoretical Mathematics at [Dauphine-PSL University](https://dauphine.psl.eu/).

During my undergraduate studies, I worked on a project titled _[Numerical Propagation of Trajectories of Earth-Orbiting Spacecraft](https://github.com/victorballester7/final-bachelor-thesis)_ under the guidance of [J.M. Mondelo](https://bgsmath.cat/people/?person=josep-maria-mondelo). This experience introduced me to the world of numerical methods and their applications in aerospace engineering.  

During my master in Paris, I specialized in Computational Fluid Dynamics. My final project, _[2D Turbulence Spreading](https://github.com/victorballester7/final-master-thesis)_, was supervised by [A. Alexakis](https://www.phys.ens.fr/~alexakis/) and [E. Dormy](https://www.phys.ens.fr/~alexakis/).  

In October 2024, I began my PhD, focusing on the transition to turbulence over airplane wings using direct numerical simulations with a spectral/hp element method approach. I am being supervised by [S. Sherwin](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/people/s.sherwin) and [Y. Hwang](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/people/y.hwang).  

Outside of academia, I enjoy cycling and hiking, which keep me active and allow me to explore nature.
