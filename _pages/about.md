Hey there! I'm VÃ­ctor, a PhD candidate in Aeronautics at [Imperial College London](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/). I grew up in Badalona, a city near Barcelona. I did my undergraduate studies in Mathematics at [Autonomous University of Barcelona](https://www.uab.cat/). Then I moved to Paris, where I pursued my master's degree in Applied and Theoretical Mathematics at [Dauphine-PSL University](https://dauphine.psl.eu/).

During my undergraduate studies, I had the opportunity to work on a project titled _[Numerical propagation of trajectories of Earth-orbiting spacecraft](https://github.com/victorballester7/final-bachelor-thesis)_. With the guidance of [J.M. Mondelo](https://bgsmath.cat/people/?person=josep-maria-mondelo), I delved into the world of numerical methods and their applications in aerospace engineering. This experience ignited my passion for the subject.

When I'm not immersed in my academic pursuits, you'll often find me indulging in my hobbies of cycling and hiking. They keep me active, and I love exploring the beauty of nature. I have a competitive spirit, which I bring out both in the academic realm and in sports. Over the years, I've taken part in various mathematics and physics competitions, as well as hackathons, constantly improving my problem-solving skills.

If you'd like to get in touch, feel free to reach out to me via [email](mailto:{{ site.email | encode_email }}) or send me a message on [WhatsApp](https://wa.me/{{ site.whatsapp_number }}), [Telegram](https://telegram.me/{{ site.telegram_username }}) or [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/{{ site.linkedin_username }}). I'm always eager to connect with fellow enthusiasts and explore exciting collaborative opportunities.
